# VS Code Settings
## Web Stack
Thank you for using the iTEAM Consulting VS Code workspace settings for web development. Packaged with these settings are a set of extension recommendations.  We suggest you follow these recommendations for the best development experience.

## Usage
Navigate a prompt to your project directory and run the following command:
```
git submodule add https://github.com/iteam-consulting/vsc-settings-web.git .vscode
```
This settings package uses [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) with ligatures enabled. If you do not install the font, it will default to a system font and looks terrible. We suggest you either install the font, or override the workspace setting in your environment.

*Note: make sure you are not ignoring the `.vscode` directory*
